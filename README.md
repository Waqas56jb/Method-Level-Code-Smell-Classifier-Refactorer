# Method-Level-Code-Smell-Classifier-Refactorer
This project builds a deep learning model to classify method-level code smells in Java code. It uses RNN/LSTM to detect common smell types with high accuracy. Based on classification, it automatically suggests refactoring changes to improve code quality. Includes training scripts, evaluation metrics, and refactoring examples for easy use.
